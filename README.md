This repository contains the code and simulations for a paper I co-authored on basic prediction strategies for random events. It was part of a statistics research project exploring how different strategies perform when predicting binary, ternary, discrete, and continuous outcomes under various loss functions.

We analyzed the theoretical accuracy and ran simulations to evaluate how well each prediction method performs across different scenarios, including:
- Coin flips
- Drawing from baskets with known numbers
- Predicting values from bimodal and skewed distributions
